2.AFter delteing result pod , result  was created automatically & voting and results are working porperly.

3.After deleting DB pos , DB pod was created automatically .
we can vote on web page but results are not changing .
it seems that results are still pointing to old reference DB & waiting for it, hence no change in results .


delete the result pod , it will be created automatically & will point to new DB Pod.
now both voting & results webpage are working
